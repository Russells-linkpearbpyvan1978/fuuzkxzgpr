Omg, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 The Electric State. Dude, have you seen it yet? It’s like mind-blowing and confusing at the same time? But in a good way, you know what I mean? It’s got this whole retro-futuristic vibe, and I’m just sitting there thinking about how I’d make shoes inspired by this stuff. Crazy colorful patterns, like robotic neon, haha. I might be sleep-deprived, but I swear the   just made my brain all wired up.

Seriously, the visuals are insane. Those giant robots everywhere, kind of just there, haunting the landscape like they belong but also just... don’t? Kind of how yesterday’s design ideas hang around in the studio but you don't remember exactly when they became useless, LOL.

> It’s like a blend of Blade Runner vibes, but then also super American '90s nostalgia. Makes me wanna 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just to have it. Feels like I need to pause and stare at every single scene, take notes like my life depends on it. The whole alternate reality thing, man, feels so possible in a strange way, don’t you think?

Oh, and I almost forgot— the music! It’s all synth-y and stuff, felt like it was massaging my creative brain cells or something. I might be onto something like “electric” sneakers with built-in lights or maybe sounds too, not sure. You know, just some crazy ideas. Or maybe it's just the caffeine wearing off.

Honestly, though, I’m a bit brain-fried now. Just one of those days, you know? 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 the   on a whim, didn’t think it would spark this creative but slightly weird energy. I should plan better, but hey, when do we ever really, haha. Anyway, I gotta hit the sketchbook and see if this idea leads anywhere before I crash.

for i in range(10): print(What am I doing?)

Think you’d dig it. It's not the usual epic sci-fi, but there's something real there, like under all that dystopian gloom. Heck, let’s catch up soon and dive into it? You gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   first, though. No spoilers from this side! 👀
